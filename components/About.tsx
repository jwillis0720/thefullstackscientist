                        In graduate school for life sciences, two paths are generally presented. One, the wet-lab, sometimes called an ‘experimentalist’ is traditionally what you think of when you think of a scientist. You are in a laboratory surrounded by cool equipment conducting experiments like you are on CSI: beakers, fume hoods, chemicals, DNA gels and million dollar machines. The other, the dry-lab, is typically what one thinks of as a computationalist. They spend their time conducting experiments <i>in silico</i>, running calculations to bolster the experimentalist. They are different worlds with their own set of language. In fact, I urge you to spend sometime in a room with a classic wet-lab and dry-lab person trying to communicate their science. Fun stuff.

                        In 2008, right when I started grad school, machine-learning was just making strides. There was no such thing as Deep learning yet, but there was an incredibly cool concept called 'protein design' where you could have the computer help redesign a protein (say an antibody) to make it a better thereapeutic. I thought that was so cool. But...I didn't want to hand off my designs to some snobby experimentalist. I wanted to learn how to make proteins on my own. Thus began my dual mentorship with a world renowned computationalist and immunologist. I set my career path to insersect those two worlds.

                        Here I am today. A fullstack scientist. In case you don't know that is, it's a play on the term 'fullstack developer' who a code engineer who can work on both the front end (i.e the pretty websites) and the backend (crunching data to feed the websites). I am a fullstack scientist who can work on both the computational and experimental side of science. I design and build <span className='text-green-400'>vaccines</span> and <span className='text-green-400'>antibody</span> thereapeutics. <span className='text-green-400'>I am a scientist who can compute. I am a computationalist that can do science.</span>
